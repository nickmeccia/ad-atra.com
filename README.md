## Running Locally

### Option 1: Ruby

```
$ gem install sinatra
$ gem install sass
$ ruby nickmeccia.rb
localhost:4567
```

### Option 2: Rack

```
$ bundle install
$ rackup
localhost:9292
```

Functionally, there is no difference; however, Heroku required the second method in order to deploy.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
